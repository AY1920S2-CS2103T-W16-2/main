=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `exercise delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `exercise delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Main]]
=== Main Component
.Structure of the Main Component
image::MainClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/Main.java[`Main.java`]

The `Main` class consists of the `SplashScreen` and the `MainApp`. 

When the app starts up, `Main#main` is called. This sets the `Preloader` of the `Application` to be `SplashScreen`. Thereafter, it launches `MainApp`.

During the GUI start up process, the `SplashScreen` will first load on a `Thread`. In the meantime, `MainApp#init` will run. Once `MainApp#init` completes, and just as `MainApp#start` is about to run, `MainApp` will send a `Preloader.StateChangeNotification` to `SplashScreen` to close its window. After that, `UiManager#start` is called, which creates the view for the main application.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of a `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and other panels. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{codeURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component executes user commands using the `Logic` component. 

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `ParserManager` class to parse the user command
. The `ParserManager` creates and returns a `Command` object
. The `Command` object is executed by the `LogicManager`
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a exercise).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the list of workouts.

Inside the `Logic` package, there are some utility classes such as the `ArgumentTokenizer`. It is responsible for tokenizing an input and returning an `ArgumentMultimap`, which can be used to get the value of a particular `Prefix`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Session data.
* stores the Exercise data.
* stores the Workout data.
* stores the Schedule data.
* stores the Log data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Session>`, `ObservableList<Exercise>`, `ObservableList<Workout>`, `ObservableList<ScheduledWorkout>`, `ObservableList<Log>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Zero To One`, which `Exercise` can reference. This would allow `Zero To One` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Exercise` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Zero To One data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu/zerotoone.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature [SAMPLE]
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedExerciseList`.
It extends `ExerciseList` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `ExerciseListStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedExerciseList#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedExerciseList#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedExerciseList#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitExerciseList()`, `Model#undoExerciseList()` and `Model#redoExerciseList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedExerciseList` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th exercise in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new exercise. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitExerciseList()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `ExerciseListStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the exercise was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoExerciseList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoExerciseList()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `ExerciseListStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoExerciseList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitExerciseList()`, `Model#undoExerciseList()` or `Model#redoExerciseList()`. Thus, the `ExerciseListStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitExerciseList()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `ExerciseListStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the exercise being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedExerciseList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::completedExercise[]
=== Session
==== Implementation
The Session feature resides on the Home page and is comprised of `Start`, `Stop`, `Done`, and `Skip` commands.
`OngoingSession`, `Session`, `SessionList` and `SessionSet` are models that are vital components of the feature.

The activity diagram below demonstrates the actions of a user with this feature.

.Session Feature Activity Diagram
image::StartStopActivityDiagram.png[]

Start depicts the start of a valid Session (non-zero sets remaining).
Upon depletion of all remaining sets, the completedExercise automatically stops and is saved.
The only inputs the user is required to give throughout the activity are `done` (corresponding to the yes of the conditional branch)
and `skip` (no of the conditional branch).
This is a conscious design choice as elaborated in the next section.

---

The operations handling these actions are found in OngoingSession:

* `OngoingSession#skip()/OngoingSession#done()` -- returns previous set and updates queue of remaining sets.
* `OngoingSession#finish()` -- creates and returns an immutable `Session` object for saving and logging.

Further operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#startSession()` and `Model#stopSession()`.

---

The inner workings of the feature are briefly expounded below through example usage.
`Arms Day` is a `Workout` with ID = `2` and consists of 2 sets of one exercise called `Benchpress`.

Step 1. The user selects an existing `Workout` called `Arms Day` with ID = `2` and starts a completedExercise with `start 2`.

* `Logic` and `Parser` redirects control to `StartCommand#execute()` where an instance of `OngoingSession` is created with
`Arms Day`. The upcoming set of the next exercise is displayed for the user.

Step 2. The user completes the first set and types `done`.

* `DoneCommand#execute()` is invoked, which in turn calls `OngoingSession#done()` to obtain the next set and statefully
updates the instance of `OngoingSession`.

* The rest timer starts counting from 00:00.

.DoneCommand sequence diagram
image::DoneCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 3. The user fails the last and final set of `Benchpress` and types `skip`.

* `SkipCommand#execute()` is invoked. The instance of `OngoingSession` is updated. Since `OngoingSession#hasSetLeft()`
returns false, `OngoingSession#finish()` is called which creates and returns an immutable `Session` object. This object
is saved into the `completedExerciseList` of `ModelManager` for saving and use by the `Log` feature.

[Note] In the usual flow, the `stop` command is not used, and is reserved only for a premature (incomplete) ending of a
completedExercise.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Seamless user-first experience
* **Current Implementation:** Minimal commands and typing during an ongoing completedExercise.
** Pros: Less interruption during actual exercising to enter commands.
** Cons: More experienced users are not able to have a more customizable workout.


===== Aspect: Beginner-friendly automatic set-ordering
* **Current Implementation:** Exercises and sets have fixed ordering based on their creation.
** Pros: Easier for new user to follow a completedExercise, less typing required during ongoing completedExercise.
** Cons: Experienced users are not able to have an ad-hoc customizable workout without creating a new workout with the specific order they want.
// end::completedExercise[]

// tag::exercise[]
=== Exercise
==== Implementation
The exercise feature forms the basic building block for the application. It allows users to CRUD exercises, which will then be used for the creation of workouts. The command is prefixed by the keyword `exercise`. Available commands are `create`, `edit`, `list`, `delete` and many more.

.Exercise's CreateCommand Sequence Diagram
image::exercise/CreateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

In this portion, we will trace the sequence diagram of the `exercise create` command to better understand the internals of the Exercise feature.

. The user enters the command `exercise create e/Bench Press`
. LogicManager will pass the command to the ParserManager for parsing
. ParserManager upon seeing that the command is prefixed by `exercise` creates a ExerciseCommandParser
. ParserManager then pass `create e/Bench Press` to ExerciseCommandParser
. ExerciseCommandParser upon seeing that the command is prefixed by `create` creates a CreateCommandParser
. ExerciseCommandParser then pass the argument `e/Bench Press` to CreateCommandParser
. CreateCommandParser then attempts to create an ExerciseName object using the String in the argument
. Using the ExerciseName, CreateCommandParser then create a CreateCommand object with the exercise name
. During the construction of the CreateCommand object, a new ArrayList object is created and stored in CreateCommand
. The CreateCommand is then passed back to the LogicManager
. LogicManager calls the `c.execute()`
. CreateCommand will attempt to create an Exercise using the exercise name and the empty ArrayList
. After creating the Exercise object, the CreateCommand will attempt to store the new exercise by calling the `addExercise` method of Model
. After the exercise is successfully added, a CommandResult object is created
. This result is then passed back to the LogicManager which will display the output on the GUI

==== Design Considerations
One of the consideration while designing was that the commands in exercise are extremely nested. We have commands such as `exercise set create r/1 m/10`. While we could have chucked all the parsing in `ExerciseSetCreateParser` class, we realised that it will be better if we were to abstract the parser into separate classes. This allows us to group the functionalities of the parser in a single file. For example, `ExerciseCommandParser` will parse any string that has the word `exercise` as the prefix. `SetCommandParser` will do so for a prefix of `set`. This means that for the above command, while we have to go through multiple parsers which can make the performance of the application suffer, each of the parsers have a single responsibility which makes it a better design choice.

// end::exercise[]

// tag::workout[]
=== Workout
==== Overview
The workout feature in ZeroToOne allows users to manage their workouts! Users will be able to create a workout, add exercises to it, as well as edit the workout and its exercises.

==== Components
The Workout Manager consists of a `WorkoutList`, which contains a number of workouts that the user has created.
Each workout consists of a `WorkoutId`, a `WorkoutName` and finally, an `WorkoutExerciseList`.

The following class diagram shows the overview of the Workout Manager:

.Workout Class Diagram
image::WorkoutClassDiagram.png[]

==== Workout Model
ZeroToOne's `Model` extends the `WorkoutModel`. Here are all the functions to carry out workout-related activities:

* `Model#getWorkoutListFilePath()` - Retrieves the `Path` of the `WorkoutList`
* `Model#setWorkoutListFilePath(Path workoutListFilePath)` - Sets the `Path` of the `WorkoutList`
* `Model#setWorkoutList(ReadOnlyWorkoutList workoutList)` - Sets the `WorkoutList` to be a `ReadOnlyWorkoutList`
* `Model#getWorkoutList()` - Returns an unmodifiable `ReadOnlyWorkoutList`
* `Model#hasWorkout(Workout workout)` - Returns true if a workout exists in the workout list
* `Model#deleteWorkout(Workout target)` - Deletes a specified workout from the workout list
* `Model#addWorkout(Workout target)` - Adds a new workout to the workout list
* `Model#setWorkout(Workout target, Workout editedWorkout)` - Replaces a particular workout with an edited workout
* `Model#deleteExerciseFromWorkout(Exercise exercise)` - Deletes any instance of an exercise from all workouts
* `Model#getFilteredWorkoutList()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of `ObservableList<Workout>`
* `Model#updateFilteredWorkoutList(Predicate<Workout> predicate)` - Updates the filter of `FilteredWorkoutList`

==== Command Execution

To illustrate an example of a command from the Workout Manager, the following sequence diagram
depicts flow of the program when the command `workout find w/Arms Workout` is run.

.Sequence Diagram for Finding a Workout
image::WorkoutSequenceDiagram.png[]

. When the user runs the command `workout find w/Arms Workout`, the `LogicManager` will first take in the command, by calling the `execute()` function on it.
. The `ParserManager` then has to `parse("workout find w/Arms Workout"`.
. Next, the `WorkoutCommandParser` has to `parse("find w/Arms Workout")` for the command.
. Once the command has been parsed as a `FindCommand`, it will be passed on to the `FindCommandParser`, which will then create a new `WorkoutName`.
. The `FindCommandParser` can then create a `FindCommand`, which in turn creates a `PredicateFilterWorkoutName`.
. The `FindCommand` can be returned to the `LogicManager`, where it will `execute()` the `FindCommand`.
. `Model#updateFilteredWorkoutList(Predicate<Workout> predicate)` is used to update the view of the workout list to show the requested Workout(s).
. Finally, the resulting output message will be returned as the `CommandResult`.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Exercises in workout

* Option 1: Use existing `Exercise` class in `Workout`
** Advantage: Building on an existing class is simpler and more intuitive.
** Disadvantage: Introduces a dependency on the `Exercise` class
* Option 2: Create a new `WorkoutExercise` class for the `Workout` class
** Advantage: Creates an extra layer of abstraction and removes the dependency on `Exercise`.
** Disadvantage: More code needed which may be redundant.

In the end, I decided to stick with Option 1. This is because creating a new WorkoutExercise class
is redundant and unnecessary, when there is no functional difference between an Exercise and a WorkoutExercise,
other than the context that they are referenced in. In addition, this would make the deletion of any instance of a particular Exercise from a Workout easier, when an Exercise is deleted from the ExerciseList. Hence, to simplify matters, using the existing Exercise class to construct workouts was better.
// end::workout[]

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule
==== Implementation
The following sequence diagram shows how the `schedule create` operation works:

image::schedule/ScheduleCreateSequenceDiagram.png[]


The following sequence diagram shows how the `scheduledWorkout` are populated to user view:

image::schedule/PopulateSortedScheduledWorkoutList.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to handle editing and deletion of recurring schedules

* **Alternative 1:** Saves `scheduledWorkout` objects.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Hard to maintain when it comes to `edit` or `delete` of recurring scheduled workouts.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Saves `schedule` objects that can be used to produce `scheduledWorkout` when
requested.
** Pros: Changes to recurring schedules can populated to `scheduledWorkout` more easily.
** Cons: Much more complicated model.
// end::schedule[]

// tag::log[]
=== Log
For logging, we propose saving the completedExercise data in the following class architecture.

==== Implementation

image::WorkoutSessionDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Immutability was a huge consideration for us and hence we came up with the `ReadOnly` interface.

Also, due to the lack of a database backing our application, we have no choice but to nest our object.
// end::log[]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
