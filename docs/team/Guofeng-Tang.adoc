== PROJECT: ZeroToOne

---

== Overview

ZeroToOne is a desktop fitness application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented the Scheduler core feature of ZeroToOne.

** What it does: allows the user to schedule workout sessions.

** Justification: This feature is essential to the product as it enbale user to make plans of their workout sessions, stick to the plans and finally achieve a life transformation.

** Highlights: This feature affects efficiency and responsiveness if not implemented correctly. It required careful consideration and analysis of design alternatives. The implementation itself was challenging because it required implementation of a fairly complex model and its storage.

* *Code contributed on RepoSense*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=guofeng-tang&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[RepoSense]]
