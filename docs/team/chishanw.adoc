== Overview

ZeroToOne is a desktop application that serves as an all-in-one exercise tracker and personal aide. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 26 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added Workout functionality.

** *What it does*: Allows users to manage their workouts and the corresponding exercises in each of their workouts. Users can create workouts, edit their workout names, and delete workouts. Users can add existing exercises to existing workouts, edit these exercises, and delete these exercises from their workouts. This whole set of functionality can be viewed from the Workout tab in the app.

** *Justification*: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to group and organise different exercises into a workout. This allows the user to have different workouts for different fitness purposes.

** *Highlights*: This enhancement affects the existing Exercise, Schedule and Log features. Future expansions will likely utilise Workouts because it has significant practical usage in order to work out. Hence, this feature required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

** *Credits*: The base for the Workout code was the AB3 code. I morphed the AB3 code to support Workouts instead of Persons. However, it ended up significantly different from Persons, as the Workout object was different from a Person object. Hence, an additional layer of code was added to support Workout objects that in turn managed Exercise objects.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an About tab to allow users to easily access information about ZeroToOne in-app, without needing to refer to a User Guide. The tab displays some basic information about the app, and also a full list of all commands that can be executed.

*** Regularly collated and updated a list of deadlines and deliverables in our group chat, to help everyone keep track of deadlines.
*** Created a full set of app mockups while the project was still in its early planning stages, including the key user flows and UI design. This acted as a concrete goal for us to work towards as we developed the app.
