== PROJECT: ZeroToOne

---

== Overview

ZeroToOne is a desktop application that serves as an all-in-one exercise tracker and personal aide. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Workout Session Functionality*
** What it does: Allows the user to start a workout session by providing a `WORKOUT_ID`.
The session keeps track of the user's workout by providing a queue of upcoming sets and the progress of the previous set.
The session also includes a rest timer that helps users keep to their workout schedule between sets.
** Justification: This feature is a core feature within the app. It helps users keep to their workouts and ensures that even the most tired user will not forget any exercise during a workout session.
** Highlights: This feature required stellar design consideration in order to maintain a stateful representation of a workout session that is bug-free, with a user-facing experience that automatically logs completed sessions.
The `OngoingWorkout` model and related classes demonstrate this.

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Rest Timer feature*
** What it does: As part of the above *Workout Session Functionality*, the timer helps users keep to their workout schedule and times rest between sets.
** Justification: Helps users manage their time and keep to their rest time for maximum gains.
** Highlights: This feature requires the use of a thread to update the clock.
Design consideration was required to ensure that the timer was not computationally expensive yet reliable, and that the feature was user-facing and fit well within the app.
