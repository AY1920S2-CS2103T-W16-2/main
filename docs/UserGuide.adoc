== About This Document

Welcome to the ZeroToOne User Guide!

We have read and tried to follow numerous badly written user guides. They are often poorly organised, and extremely painful to read. At ZeroToOne, we seek to make your user experience a seamless and pleasurable one. This is why we created this foolproof, step-by-step guide to help you kickstart your ZeroToOne journey.

To help you better understand this document, here is a list of notations that we will be using:

.ZeroToOne Notation
[options="header"]
|======
|Notation |Description

|`exercise delete EXERCISE_ID`
| A grey highlight alongside a monospace font indicates that this is a command that can be entered into the command line and executed by the application.

|`w/<workout_name>`
| A word surrounded by arrow brackets denotes a user fillable field in the parameter

|`[d/<datetime>]`
| A parameter surrounded by square brackets indicates that it is an optional parameter

| `{e/<exercise_name> \| w/<workout_name> \| d/<datetime>}`
| A set of parameters surrounded by curly brackets indicates that at least one of the parameters have to be filled up

| `EXERCISE_ID`
| Uppercase parameters indicate that it is an index from a list in ZeroToOne
|======

== User Interface Basics

Before we delve into the commands that you can use, let us first explain the components of the User Interface, and how we can navigate through them.

.Components of the User Interface
image::UgUiComponents.png[]

=== Navigation Tabs
The navigation tabs allow you to easily access different parts of our application. Simply click on each tab to bring you to your desired feature! The coloured underline indicates which tab is currently activated and hence which feature you are currently accessing.

=== Result Display
This is where the results of your executed command will be displayed. The display will change according to the feature that you are currently using.

=== Feedback Display
Whenever you enter a command into the Command Box, the application will output a feedback message to you through this display!

=== Command Box
You type all of your commands in here. To execute the command, simply press the "Enter" button on your keyboard.

== Using ZeroToOne

At this point, you should have sufficient knowledge to start using ZeroToOne. In this section, we will describe in-depth the features that ZeroToOne has, and how you can interact with them.

=== Overview
For ZeroToOne commands, every user-fillable parameter is identified by a flag prefix. This allows ZeroToOne to accept parameters in any order. However, to correctly parse your command, we have reserved these flags as special symbols that are to be used only by the program. Please avoid using them in your commands. The reserved flags are listed as follows:

* `e/` - exercise name
* `w/` - workout name
* `s/` - number of sets
* `r/` - number of reps
* `m/` - weights (in kilograms)
* `d/` - datetime
* `f/` - frequency of schedule
* `p/` - file path

=== Getting Help
Can’t remember the commands off the top of your head? Fret not. ZeroToOne provides you with a convenient way to view a list of all available commands that you can try. Simply enter the following command into the command box:

```
help
```

.Help Window
image::UgHelp.png[]

A pop-up window will appear, showing you a list of all available commands that you can try.


=== Closing ZeroToOne (In Progress)
After you have finished using the application, you can exit the application by simply entering the following command into the command box:

`exit`

The application will close gracefully, and all data in the current usage session will be saved in the data directory. If the command is executed successfully, you should see the following message before the application closes:

```
Thank you for using ZeroToOne! Your data has been saved successfully. Hope to see you soon for your next workout!
```

=== Starting A Workout Session

Are you ready to start working out now? To begin a new workout session, simply enter the following command into the command box:

```
start WORKOUT_ID
```

```
Example use:
start 1
```

.Started Workout
image::UgStartWorkout.png[]

The User Interface will automatically switch to the “General” tab. ZeroToOne will start displaying every exercise set in your workout, guiding you through set by set in your workout.

```
NOTE:
* This command assumes that you have already created a workout in the application. If you have not, refer to the section on "Managing your workouts" to create a new workout.
* WORKOUT_ID cannot be null and should be a value from the command `workout list`
```

=== Completing An Exercise Set
Completed your exercise set? To mark the current exercise set as completed and move on to the next set, simply enter this command into the command box:

```
done
```

.Done Set
image::UgDoneSet.png[]

The background color of the completed set will turn green in a few seconds, indicating that the set is successfully completed. ZeroToOne will then progress your workout forward, by starting on the next set. If you are already on your last set, ZeroToOne will automatically stop the workout session after this command is executed.

=== Skipping An Exercise Set
Unable to complete your current exercise set? No worries, it happens to everyone. To skip the current exercise set, simply enter this command into the command box:

```
skip
```

.Skipped Set
image::UgSkippedSet.png[]

The background color of the completed set will turn red for a few seconds, indicating that the set is incomplete. ZeroToOne will then progress your workout forward, by starting on the next set. If you are already on your last set, ZeroToOne will automatically stop the workout session after this command is executed.

=== Stopping A Workout Session
Need to stop the workout session prematurely? Simply enter this command into the command box:

```
stop
```

ZeroToOne will stop the workout that is currently in progress, and will stop tracking the progress of this workout. The user interface will automatically return to the main screen. Any incomplete sets will be logged by ZeroToOne. If stopping a workout session is successful, you should see the following in the feedback display:


```
