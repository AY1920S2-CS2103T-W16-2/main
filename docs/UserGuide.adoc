== Introduction
ZeroToOne is a one-stop application for managing your exercise regimes. Transform yourself from a ‘0’ to ‘1’ in no time!

ZeroToOne has 4 major features for you that we think you will find useful.

Firstly, add any custom weight training exercises you want and create a workout. Popular exercises and workouts come by default!

Next, plan your workouts in the schedule and get timely reminders so you never miss a workout again.

Now that it is time for a workout session, get started with the session feature in the home tab, which serves as a follow-along guide that helps you time your rest and remembers which exercises are next up for you.

Our logging feature automatically tracks your session when you are done and provides in-depth details of your progress.
